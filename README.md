Rig-Builder Pro is a resourceful application that allows users to build their own personal computer. Whether users want to build a new computer from scratch or have the application guide them through the building process, Rig-Builder Pro will help users create the perfect computer to meet their needs.

## Description

Rig-Builder Pro allows users two options for building computers. The first is a "Build My Own" option and the second is a "Build For Me" option. Using the expertise of A.I., the compatibility of all components will be checked to make sure everything will work as efficiently as possible. Our application allows users the ability to choose from many different components and it provides the user some feedback to help them choose the best parts for their computer. Rig-Builder Pro also allows a Budget option to help the user build a computer that they can afford.

## Installation

Using this application from the files would require a few steps: 
``` 
npm i && npm run develop
``` 
However, the ai functions in the 'Build For Me' page will not be available in the raw files due to excluding our .env containing our OpenAI API key. 

To combat this, a new .env may be created with a personal OpenAI Key or our website can easily be used through a link instead: [Render link (empty)]()

## Usage

This application is public and the code can easily be cloned to be used by anyone as it was made under an MIT License.

## Acknowledgements 

We would like to thank our Instructor, TAs, and many tutors for helping and guiding us to this point. This is simply a product of our combined learning and efforts through bootcamp, and this would have not been made possible without them, the documentations of many packages and APIs, and edX.
